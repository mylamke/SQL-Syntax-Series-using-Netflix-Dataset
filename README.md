# SQL Syntax Series using Netflix Dataset 

This project demonstrates how to use SQL for analyzing a Netflix dataset. The analysis is performed in Python utilizing Pandas and SQLite, which enables efficient data manipulation and querying. 

## Project Overview

show_id: Unique identifier for each show/movie

type: Indicates whether the entry is a movie or TV show

rating: Age rating of the show/movie

duration: Duration of the movie or number of seasons for TV shows

listed_in: Categories or genres the show/movie belongs to

description: A brief description of the show/movie

## Key Features

Data Loading: The Netflix dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and then exported to a SQLite database.

SQL Queries: The notebook contains several SQL queries that demonstrate different SQL operations, such as selecting specific columns, filtering data, and limiting the number of results.

Data Analysis: The SQL queries are used to extract meaningful insights from the Netflix dataset.
